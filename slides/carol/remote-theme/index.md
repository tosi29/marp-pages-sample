# Remote theme demo

Using Classmethod's published **classmethod** theme via a direct URL.

---

## Why use a remote theme?

- Prototype quickly without copying theme files
- Reuse styles hosted elsewhere
- Mix remote themes with local ones in the same deck

---

## Tips

1. Set the `theme` front matter to the CSS URL.
2. Keep a fallback plan in case the remote resource disappears.
3. Pin the URL to a specific commit for reproducibility.
